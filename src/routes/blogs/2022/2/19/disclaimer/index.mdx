## Why i write this blog?

First of all, I write this blog for myself to explore programming things and to learn English.
I'm not intending to build a so-called community or any kind of it. Just me and my experience about life around me.

You should not read this. In fact, you should close these tabs.
If you experience annoying while reading my blog then once again, ["you should stop it"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l60MnDJklnM)
