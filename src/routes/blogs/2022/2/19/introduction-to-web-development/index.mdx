**Question:** Wow wow wow! what's the hell is this?

**Answer:** For now, we only put our attention on the below highlight line.

```html{5}
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head></head>
<body>
  <span style="color: red" onclick="this.style.color='blue'">hello world</span>
</body>
</html>
```

Basically, above line saying:

- create me a [tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tag) with content of `hello world`:

```html
<span ...>hello world</span>
```

> Think of `tag` like a container, you will put your stuff into it, whatever it's. Whether it's a `text`, `image`, `video`, ...
> and you can direct styling using [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), control its behavior with specific kind of input ([click](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click), [double click](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/dblclick_event), [scroll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/scroll_event) your mouse...), change it content, ... with help of [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript#for_complete_beginners)

Just think, in general, `span` is a box where `<span>` is the lid of the box and `</span>` is the bottom of it.
We put stuff into box through the lid which is `<span>` tag.

So tag's format will look like:

```html
<!-- normal elements -->
<element attribute="value" attribute="value" ...>element content</element>

<!-- no-ending elements -->
<element attribute="value" attribute="value" ... />

<!-- void elements -->
<element attribute="value" attribute="value" ...></element>
```

- color those text with red color

```html
<span style="color: red">...</span>
```

> `<span style="">` mean "i want to change how this `span` tag look like"
> and it is `color: red`

This's what i call **inline style**. There're **external**, **internal** and **inline** style for you to know
. We can put many, many style on this inline style with format `style="property: value; property: value; ..."`

- and when i click on it

```html
<span onclick="..."></span>
```

- turn its text style color into blue

```js
this.style.color = "blue";
```

> we'll later talk about `this`, `this.style`, `this.style.color = ...`

---

**Question:** So... if the `span` thing can do all the job, why waste time writing down all other (non-highlight) things?

<br />

**Answer:** yes, you can do it, believe me go ahead to [example](#example-1) and delete all other line
. So it look like this and of course it's still work

```html{5}
<span style="color: red" onclick="this.style.color='blue'">hello world</span>
```

It look like waste, redundancy code but trust me we'll need it for later development

## Development

To sum up, web development is to create a `*.html` with your content inside. Of course, real-world development is much more than just to create a `*.html`.

But for now, \*.html file is enough for us to understand big-image of web development

### Where to start?

- **online development**
  You could use some online editor like [codepen](https://codepen.io/trending),[jsbin](https://jsbin.com/), [stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/), ... just paste some html code and start explore
- **local development**
  - **raw file html**
    - create file `index.html`
    - paste below code and save it
      ```html
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html lang="en">
        <head></head>
        <body>
          <span style="color: red" onclick="this.style.color='blue'"
            >hello world</span
          >
        </body>
      </html>
      ```
    - open file on any browser
  - **localhost server**:
    For me, one fast, easy way is to start localhost, is to use extension [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb)
    - install, open `Web Server for Chrome`
    - choose folder where you save your `index.html` file
    - check switch button so `Web Server: STARTED`
    - open your Web Server Url print on screen, eg: [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000)
    - there we go
- or [website's inspect](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/inspect-element-in-chrome), [view page resourse](https://www.lifewire.com/view-html-source-in-chrome-3466725)
  - if you're using Safari you need [Enabling Web Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/Web_Inspector_Tutorial/EnableWebInspector/EnableWebInspector.html) first.

### What's next

- read my blog about [Introduction to HTML](/2022/02/24/introduction-to-html/)
- The purpose of this article is introduce you to basic idea of web development. We'll later explore more about [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript#for_complete_beginners), ...
- You should explore more about [HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
