The following article will guide you through some basic concept about HTML.
We'll look into below **HTML** code and try to understand what each line of code does, and how can we expand it for our personal use case.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <span>hello world</span>
  </body>
</html>
```

## HTML?

> [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML) (**H**yperText **M**arkup **L**anguage) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.

HTML is a series of [elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element), which you use to enclose, wrap, markup, ... different parts of the content in a certain way. It can be simple or complicated as the web developer wants it to be.

For example:
if we want some part of text to stand by itself, we can enclose it inside paragraph element [`<p>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p)
, and if we want some other part of text to be bold, we can use [`<strong>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong) element.

```html
<p>
  the <strong>quick</strong> brown fox jumps over the <strong>lazy</strong> dog
</p>
```

will output:

> <p>
>   the <strong>quick</strong> brown fox jumps over the <strong>lazy</strong>{" "}
>   dog
> </p>

## HTML element

- tag

  > [Tags](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#elements-2) are used to delimit the **start** and **end** of **elements** in the markup.
  > In `<span></span>`, `<span>` is start tag and `</span>` is end tag

- elements

  > An [element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element) is a part of a webpage. In [XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/XML) and [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML), an element may contain a data item or a chunk of text or an image, or perhaps nothing.
  > A typical element includes an opening tag with some attributes, enclosed text content, and a closing tag.

  There's are 6 kind of HTML elements, which is:

  - void (empty) elements: only have a start tag, end tags must not be specified for void elements.
    `area`, `base`, `br`, `col`, `embed`, `hr`, `img`, `input`, `link`, `meta`, `param`, `source`, `track`, `wbr`

    ```html
    <img
      src="workplace.jpg"
      alt="Workplace"
      usemap="#workmap"
      width="400"
      height="379"
    />

    <map name="workmap">
      <area
        shape="rect"
        coords="34,44,270,350"
        alt="Computer"
        href="computer.htm"
      />
      <area
        shape="rect"
        coords="290,172,333,250"
        alt="Phone"
        href="phone.htm"
      />
      <area
        shape="circle"
        coords="337,300,44"
        alt="Cup of coffee"
        href="coffee.htm"
      />
    </map>
    ```

  - template elements: `template`

    ```html
    <template id="row">
      <tr>
        <td>content</td>
      </tr>
    </template>
    ```

  - raw text elements: `style`, `script`

    ```html
    <style>
      body {
        background-color: grey;
      }
    </style>
    <script>
      document.body.style.backgroundColor = "grey";
    </script>
    ```

  - escapable raw text elements: `textarea`, `title`

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <title>this's browser tab title</title>
      </head>
    </html>
    ```

  - foreign elements: `math`
  - normal elements: all other [`HTML element`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

- anatomy:

  ```html
  start tag | -----------| end tag | | |
  <p attribute>the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</p>
  | | | | | | | | | |---------------------------- content --------| |
  |------------------------------------- element -------------|
  ```

  - **start tag**: marks where the elements begin to take effect. This consists of the name of elements and its attribute (optional).
    Read more about start tag format [here](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#start-tags)

  - **tag attribute**: attributes has a name and a value. Attribute names must consist of more than one character and attribute value is mixture of text and character reference;

    ```html
    <p style="color: red; text-transform: capitalize"></p>
    ```

  - **content**: this's content of element. It could contains some other tag inside of it but in this case, it contains text.

  - **end tag**: this marks where elements ends. Not include, fail to provide ending tags at right position might produce strange, unexpected behavior.
    Read more about start tag format [here](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#end-tags)

## Doctype

**DOCTYPEs** (`<!doctype html>`) are required for legacy reasons. When omitted, browsers tend to use a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.

## Html

Also referred to as the **_root element_** is the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, all other elements must be descendant of this element.

<br />

## Head

the `<head>` element is the part of HTML document that does not display through web page.
It primarily holds:

- website's metadata - machine readable information:
  - data of author
  - browser tab title
  - website's important description, keywords for other people to lookup using google, bing, duckduckgo,...)
  - information for machine processing
- external link to [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- internal css style
- web browsers might also use metadata provided in `<head>` to render HTML documents correctly.
- ...

HTML5-compliant browsers automatically create a `<head>` element if its tags are omitted in the markup

<br />

## Body

This's where all fun begin. The `<body>` element represent the content of HTML document and there's only one `<body>` element in document.

It's hard to tell what to do with `<body>` cause it's really depend on the design and layout of the website, but we have some option for basic use case:

- media element: `<img>`, `<figure>`, `<source>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, ...
- paragraph: `<p>`, `<blockquote>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, ...
- heading: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, ..., `<h6>`
- table: `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, `<tr>`
- list: `<ol>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`
- content division: `<br>`, `<hr>`, `<div>`
- general inline container: `<span>`
- menu: `<select>`, `<option>`
- hyperlink: `<a>`
- user input: `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<div contenteditable></div>`
- .....

You can find much more of HTML elements and its feature [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element). We have a lot of tags but in real world using, `div`, `span`, `img`, `a`, `video`, `audio`, `input`, `textarea`,... are the lost using tag. Most of the time, we can replace most of the other tag using `div`

<br />

## Summary

Below is basic format of a website:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- you don't really need to worry about this tag -->
<html lang="en">
  <!-- and this tag -->
  <head>
    <!-- website's metadata, external content -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- this's where we create website content -->
  </body>
</html>
```
